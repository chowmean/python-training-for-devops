# Generators

Generators are just like normal functions, what makes functions generators in yield statement instead of return statement. 

## What is yield?

Yield is a key word that is used to return the value only, the difference is it is used to induce the lazy processing capability. What is does is it returns the state of the functions at that time and save it locally so that it can be resumed from there in the next iteration.
